# About
The Pixel Perfect theme was designed exclusively for the retro handheld console R36S, running ArkOS (It may work in other specifications but it may need adaptations). 

I cannot give support for this theme, what I did here was modify an existing theme to my liking, I do not garantee that it will work perfectly for you. I simply changed and adapted the aspects that I wanted. 

If you have any questions I may not be able to answer them since I am not well versed on creating themes for Emulation Station.
